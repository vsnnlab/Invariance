### 1. System requirements
- MATLAB 2021b or later version
- Installation of the Deep Learning Toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
- Installation of the pretrained AlexNet (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-alexnet-network)
- No non-standard hardware is required.
- Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2021b.

### 2. Installation
- Download all files and folders. ("Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP")
- Download 'Image.zip' from below link and unzip files in the same directory
- [Data URL] : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11KLOOW4QfqVQn0DqwGdXoUTyB0xxhmtw
- Expected Installation time is about 60 minutes, but may vary by system conditions.
 
### 3. Instructions for demo
- Edit "Main.m' to select the class of the object-selective units to which perform analysis.
- Select result numbers (from 1 to 5) that you want to perform a demo simulation.
- Expected running time is about 5 minutes for each figure, but may vary by system conditions.

### 4. Expected output for demo
- Below results for untrained AlexNet will be shown.
  - Result 1) Emergence of selectivity to various objects in untrained networks
  - Result 2) Viewpoint-invariant object selectivity observed in untrained networks
  - Result 3) Viewpoint-invariant unit and specific units and its visual feature encoding
  - Result 4) Computational model explains spontaneous emergence of invariance in untrained networks
  - Result 5) Invariantly tuned unit responses enable invariant object detection
